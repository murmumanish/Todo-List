# Todo List 

This is a basic Todo List application built with Express.js. 
It provides simple REST APIs to get, add, update, and delete tasks. 
The project demonstrates how a backend CRUD API works using Node.js and Express, and it is implemented using CommonJS modules

# How Data is Stored.

Currently we store our all tasks in `todos.json` file as JSON Array.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "task": "Clean my House",
    "completed": true
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "task": "Complete my DSA Assignment",
    "completed": false
  }
]
```

# APIs

It Lists all the Task Available.

#### Example: 
```bash

  }
]
```

# 1. Add Task
